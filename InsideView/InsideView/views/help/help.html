           <h4>How often do I need to do a maintenance check on my AED?</h4>
           Perform maintenance checks on your AED(s) with a frequency in line with your organization’s established standards.  AED manufacturers require varying frequency of maintenance checks, ranging from daily to monthly, depending on make / model.  You can find this information in your AED owner’s manual (see ‘Resources’ tab on your AGS Certification Center to download the appropriate manual if needed).  AED laws typically require that the AED is maintained per Manufacturer’s recommendation.  AGS Certification requires that AED maintenance checks be performed at least monthly on each AED.

            <h4>How many Trained responders should my facility have?</h4>
            Of course the more people that are AED/CPR trained the better.  AGS Certification requires that at least one person who is AED/CPR Certified trained be available for each AED during all hours that a facility is operating.  It is also important to also build in redundancy to cover unforeseen absences, breaks, shift changes, etc.  As the nature and operations of each organization vary, appropriate numbers of trained responders vary as well.   With tools such as our proprietary Measured ReponseTM model, AGS can assist you in selecting an appropriate number of Trained Responders for your organization.

The inspector provides assistance with the information download from the AED, getting the AED back in service, and also provides some qualitative feedback and emotional support based upon his/her professional experience. The inspector will also perform a complimentary full inspection of your facility should you so desire.
